<h1>Sokoban game using Client-Server TCP/IP protocol. The entire project is event-driven development on MVC architecture. All the projects are according to the acceptable design patterns and OOP principles.
The game has three parts to it, the web application, the client and the server, each one is an independent piece of it's own and can be taken to be used alone.
The algorithms and STRIPS are in the server part.

For start, run the server on desired port and connect the client to it, afterwards you can run the algorithms and ask for solution from the server.</h1>
